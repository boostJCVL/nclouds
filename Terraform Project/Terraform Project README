This Terraform Project is designed to create a Virtual Private Cloud (VPC) that contains 3 public subnets as well as 3 private subnets on AWS.
The “loadbalancer” module will create a load balanced website by using web servers that will run Nginx.
An Elastic File System (EFS) will host the website itself by pulling resources from Amazon S3.
The Autoscaling group will ensure high availability in case an availability zone somehow goes offline.
